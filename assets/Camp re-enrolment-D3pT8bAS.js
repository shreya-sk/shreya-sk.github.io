Hi!


Thanks for joining us at our Robot Engineers camp on Tuesday. I'd like to extend an invitation and discount for your child to continue studying STEM with us during the school term - we have a variety of classes for all age groups and skill levels, and we'd love to continue your child's STEM journey 🙂


**Robot Engineers** (Y2-Y7) is the continuation of the holiday camp as a weekly class. Students will be able to continue their progress and work through the full series of robots and components, learning the coding for each step. Uses block-based coding, great for beginners. Groups in Chatswood are available Tue-Thu after school, and Sat morning and afternoon. [Full timetable here](https://stemlook.com.au/chatswood-coding-robotics-school/ ).

  
**Python Coders** (Y5-Y8) is a more advanced coding course with the line-based Python language as used in industry, robotics and AI. Students learn the fundamentals of coding in Python and make simple games. Chatswood group is Mondays 6:30pm - [read more on our website](https://stemlook.com.au/products/python-coding/?attribute_pa_location=chatswood&attribute_pa_day-time=mon-630-730pm&attribute_pa_part=part-1&attribute_pa_term-bundle=term-3 "https://stemlook.com.au/products/python-coding/?attribute_pa_location=chatswood&attribute_pa_day-time=mon-630-730pm&attribute_pa_part=part-1&attribute_pa_term-bundle=term-3").


As thanks for coming to our holiday camp, students new to our term classes can receive $30 off an order for Term 3 classes - use code **Camp30** on checkout. 🙂


Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or would like to set up a trial lesson.

Hi!

  

I hope your child enjoyed their robotics class on Monday :) Together we built EasyBot starter robots, programmed them to any desired LED flashing pattern and DC motor movements, and then customized them with additional parts and extensions. All the students performed extremely well and took genuine interest in making their own robot.

  

Due to this, I'd like to extend an invitation to continued robotics classes during Term 1 2024. We have a lot more than EasyBot on offer, with dozens of robotics projects, each teaching about a new component and programming technique. Students progress at their own pace through our online learning system, with one-on-one support from our educators according to their specific needs and progression. Most students progress onto competitions, or they move into advanced coding like Python and AI GPT Architects; using the foundations they built from programming their robots.

  

Should your child be interested in continuing with robotics, here are the timetables for our locations. The appropriate class is "Robot Engineers" - you can click on any timeslot for more information and to book.
