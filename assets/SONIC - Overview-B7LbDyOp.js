const n=`Here’s an updated and expanded version of the **Sonic Tools & Technology Documentation**, incorporating the diagnostic workflow and Fetch account setup details from the latest message. This version is designed to help clarify how support staff (like you) can **investigate stuck Fetch batches**, distinguish between server-side and client-side issues, and understand the overall tooling landscape.

# 🧭 Sonic Tools & Technology Overview

_Last updated: 2 June 2025_  
_Compiled for onboarding, internal support staff, and cross-team clarity_

---

## 🧩 Summary

Sonic Healthcare’s IT ecosystem includes a wide range of internal platforms, clinical systems, and integration tools that together support the generation, routing, and delivery of pathology and radiology results. These systems are supported by multiple teams (e.g., **EXT DEV**, **Client IT**, **Hosting**, **Server Group**, etc.).

This guide covers:

- Core Sonic platforms like **Apollo**, **RIS**, **LIS**
    
- Infrastructure responsibilities of the **Server Group**
    
- **Fetch3** download issues and diagnostic procedures
    
- The role of support teams vs Client IT

## 🔧 Key Platforms and Tools

### 🧠 Apollo

Apollo is Sonic’s **internal integration and control platform**. It manages:

- Electronic result delivery
    
- Fetch batch queues and troubleshooting
    
- HL7 messaging and diagnostic tools
    
- User permissions and account configurations
    

You’ll often access Apollo to:

- **Re-queue stuck batches**
    
- Check **site status**
    
- Configure or simulate **Fetch downloads**
    
- View **HL7 logs** and **audit trails**
    

You can also trigger download simulations via **test Fetch accounts** (see below).

---

### 🧪 LIS – Laboratory Information System

Used primarily for **test ordering**, **specimen tracking**, and **results validation**. LIS connects to Apollo for transmitting results downstream.

- Different labs use different LIS platforms (e.g., Ultra, Delphic)
    
- Fetch integration from LIS is sometimes **less flexible** than RIS (e.g., no native dequeue functionality)
    

---

### 🖼️ RIS – Radiology Information System

Used for:

- Radiology workflow scheduling
    
- Imaging results/reporting
    
- PACS and modality integration
    
- Direct HL7 integration with Apollo
    

RIS Fetch interface **includes tools** for batch dequeueing, unlike LIS.

## 📥 Fetch3, DMZ and Result Delivery

### What is Fetch3?

**Fetch3** is Sonic’s custom-built **Windows application** that downloads diagnostic results from Sonic’s servers (hosted in the DMZ) to GP clinics, specialists, and hospital systems. It connects over HTTPS to receive batches generated by Apollo/ERD.

It:

- Pulls **pend.htm** summary files for validation
    
- Downloads result payloads (up to **10 MB per batch**)
    
- Sends back **ACK**s (acknowledgements)
    

If the batch is too big or fails, the Fetch3 client may get “stuck” retrying it repeatedly, which leads to delivery failure.

---

## 🚧 Diagnosing Fetch Issues

When a support ticket says: **"Fetch3 not working"**, follow this **standard investigation process**:

### Step 1: Setup Your Own Test Fetch Account

To simulate and test Fetch3 downloads yourself:

1. Go to **[http://mgmt](http://mgmt/)** and create a Fetch account (no doctor-codes).
    
2. In Apollo (for each RIS/LIS namespace), add the same account with:
    
    - \`Send Pending Reports = Y\`  
        This ensures that when Fetch connects, an HTML \`pend.htm\` file is generated.
        
3. Install the Fetch3 client from:  
    [www.sonichealthcare.com/fetch](http://www.sonichealthcare.com/fetch)
    
4. Log in using your test account to check:
    
    - If the Download Service responds
        
    - If logs are generated correctly
        
    - If a connection is established with the DMZ endpoint
        

> ✅ **Why this helps**: Confirms whether Fetch3 itself, the account setup, and the server endpoint are all behaving correctly.

---

### Step 2: Use Apollo Logs + Fetch3 Logs

When a Fetch site reports an issue:

- Go into Apollo → Fetch → check **batch size**, **retry count**, and **download logs**
    
- Use F12 → "Client Diagnostics" to request a log dump
    
- Use Fetch3 Log Analyser:  
    [http://nrytools/Fetch3LogAnalyser/](http://nrytools/Fetch3LogAnalyser/)
    

If no ACK is received from the client:

- It's either a client problem (permissions, disk full, etc.)
    
- Or the batch is oversized (>10MB)
    

---

### Step 3: Classify and Respond

|Scenario|Action|
|---|---|
|Batch > 10MB|De-queue using backend scripts (LIS) or Apollo (RIS), re-queue episodes|
|Client didn’t ACK|Ask Client IT to run diagnostics (log zip, analyser)|
|File system / disk full|Push ticket back – Client IT to resolve|
|DMZ unreachable|Check Fetch account config, validate via your test account|

> 💡 **Note**: Only EXT DEV should be handling server-side fixes. Most client-side errors are resolvable by Client IT.

---

### 🔁 Re-Queueing and Dequeueing Batches

#### For RIS:

- Can dequeue from Apollo directly using UI (Fetch CHUI)
    

#### For LIS:

- Dequeue requires backend scripts (Client IT can’t run these)
    
- EXT DEV or Hosting may assist
    

After dequeueing:

- Re-queue individual episodes back into the delivery queue
    

---

## 🏢 Infrastructure: The Server Group

The **Server Group** maintains Sonic’s internal and cloud systems. This includes:

|Function|Technology|
|---|---|
|Email, Fax, HR|Exchange, RightFax, iChris|
|Domain Auth|Active Directory (internal + DMZ)|
|Cloud Hosting|AWS, Route 53, SSL certs|
|Desktop Mgmt|SCCM, Commvault|
|Security|Zscaler, Proofpoint|

They support **Fetch infrastructure in the DMZ**, including:

- IIS + WCF services for download
    
- Fetch download endpoints
    
- Certificates and routing

## 🧪 Example Fetch Investigation Flow

\`\`\`plaintext
Ticket: "Fetch not working at Clinic XYZ"

✅ Step 1: Use your test Fetch account to confirm the service works  
✅ Step 2: Go into Apollo → Fetch → check batch size, logs, and retries  
❌ No ACKs? Ask Client IT to run diagnostics, upload log to Log Analyser  
📦 Batch is 11MB? Dequeue + requeue episodes  
💽 Client disk full or no permissions? Push ticket back to Client IT  
📬 Still unsure? Escalate to EXT DEV or Hosting
\`\`\`

---
## ✅ Key Reminders

- Do **not** clear all waiting results from Apollo unless directed
    
- Client IT should resolve client-side issues before escalation
    
- If a test Fetch account fails, the issue is likely on the **server-side**
    
- RIS has better Fetch tools than LIS – raise a Spock task to improve LIS Fetch CHUI
